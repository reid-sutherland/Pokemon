# Help!
This README will walk you through the steps of downloading and modifying our code to implement our game!

Vocabulary (I know, this is starting to feel like school, ugh)
* Directory: This is a place in your computer where files can be stored, lots of people call this a "folder".
* Repository: A place where we can store code for a project on Github.


## Set up
You should be on the main page for this project now, which you can find at this link: [https://github.com/reid-sutherland/Pokemon](https://github.com/reid-sutherland/Pokemon)

### Download
First, we need to "clone" our code from the "repository" where our starting code can be found
  1. Click the green **Clone or download** button on the right side of the screen
  2. Click **Download Zip**
The Project will be downloaded as a "zip" file, and it will be placed in your local "Downloads" directory
  1. Open a Finder window
  2. Click the "Downloads" directory on the left side of the window
  3. Click and drag the **Pokemon-master.zip** file to your "Documents" directory, which is also on the left side
To _un-zip_ the zip file... 
  1. Navigate to your Documents directory in Finder
  2. Double-click the **Pokemon-master.zip** file
  3. A folder should pop up with the name **Pokemon-master**
  4. If so, then you can delete the zip file, or leave it there

### Import Project
Now, we need to import our project code to IntelliJ so we can make changes, and test our work
   1. First, open IntelliJ by double-clicking the "IJ" icon in the toolbar (Mac computers call this a Dock) at the bottom of your desktop
   2. From the pop-up menu, select **Import Project**
   3. Find your Documents directory. If you can't find it in the menu that pops up, ask me for help, I don't know exactly what your computer's filesystem looks like
   4. Click on the Pokemon-master directory, then click the blue **OK** button. This should cause a new window to pop up.
From here, IntelliJ gives you a lot of options to choose from when building your project.
For this class, we just need the basic options:
   1. Click the blue **Next** button at the bottom of the window
   2. Keep clicking the **Next** button, we just need the default settings
   3. Eventually the **Next** button will change to **Finish**. Click **Finish** and your project should open up in the editor window
   
##### Now we have our project open in our editor window!

### Make your code runnable
To make our code runnable, we need to add a build configuration (you don't have to know what this means) :)
   1. First,
